## Implementation Decisions
The general idea I wanted to follow was something like this:

A low polygon modeling of a planet with models that are constrastingly large for the planet.

I decided i would do something similar, and make my own models and effects for the project.

The first decision was how to make the planet. I found on the Three.js documentation a geometry shape named Icosahedron and noticed it looked exactly like the examples i've found online!

Then i decided i'd create a small 'wooden house' and some trees.
