# graphicsPlanet

## Implementation Decisions
The general idea I wanted to follow was something like this:

<img src="graphicsPlanet/images/planetex1.PNG" alt="1st" class="inline"/>

A low polygon modeling of a planet with models that are constrastingly large for the planet.

<img src="graphicsPlanet/images/planet1.PNG" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
